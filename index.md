## About My Project

I am working on a data cleaning system called CoWrangler. It is a recommender system for data-wrangling.
The goal of the system is to inform and accelerate the data wrangling process by (1) recommending the most meaning- ful transformations with explanations in real-time, (2) generating human-readable and efficient code, and (3) enabling flexibility with HITL interactions for intent expression.
