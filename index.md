## About My Project

I am working on a data-wrangling recommender system called [CoWrangler](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3555041.3589722).
The goal of the system is to assist and accelerate the data wrangling process by (1) recommending the most next best transformations with explanations in realtime, (2) generating human-readable and efficient data-wrangling code, and (3) enabling flexibility through human-in-the-loop interactions.
