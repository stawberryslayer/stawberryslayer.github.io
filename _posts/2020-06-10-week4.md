The ":" after the for loop is causing trouble:

Final solution: If a line is not recoginzed, then collect this line and output it 


4, Implement quality control for the notebooks
The code would need parameters: Minimum valid operations, upvotes, number of dataset.

Minimum valid operations: parse the notebook to json and see how many wrangling, we only want the note book with certain minimum number of operations, they are viewed as good quality.

Number of dataset: we want to ensure that the notebooks are from at least n datasets

upvotes: notebooks with higher upvotes have better quality
