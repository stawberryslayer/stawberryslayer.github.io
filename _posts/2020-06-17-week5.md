I need to format to code for other team members to use it

Implement quality control for the notebooks

The code would need parameters: Minimum valid operations, upvotes, number of dataset.



Minimum valid operations: parse the notebook to json and see how many wrangling, we only want the note book with certain minimum number of operations, they are viewed as good quality.

Step 3 in week 2 cannot be resolved

Number of dataset: we want to ensure that the notebooks are from at least n datasets
