1, Update the format of code for other team members to use it.
Organize the directory so that it has a clear hirearchy, the user can navigate to the src folder and run the program like a python module, with no hardcoded parameters.
Move all the program parameters in cocnfig.py

2, Keep track of current notebook pages, donâ€™t crawl repeat notebooks

3, We decide not to process files with several notebooks because these notebooks in kaggle often do machine learning tasks with train and test csvs, and they have different type of data wranging operations as our project.
