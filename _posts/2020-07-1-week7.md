### Debug the crawl to see reasons of rate limit

Add dataframe name and dataset name to the summary excel sheet

Implement retry mechanism: sleep for a while and restart, prevent rate limit, and error hadling for connection error

### Cluster the apply operations:

Do the preprocess on excel sheet
Implent extract-var to get the variable name inside apply/mapping operations

We want to make sense of what the variable represents

Some appraches are knowing how many if and return statements it have, lambda operations, map with dictionaries

### Explore alternative approach
Another way is to start with the dataset, find the dataset with low usability score, then find and download its notebooks
